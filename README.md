Ryalto's Developer Page - Technical Exercise
</h1>

My task was to build and enhance Ryalto's developer page, enabling users to read blog posts, learn more about the team, and explore potential career opportunities. The website was created using HTML and CSS, featuring a fully responsive design. As this page targets developers, I aimed to make it interesting and help people easily find useful information. I primarily used blue and orange-yellow colours for the design, matching our brand logo. This approach ensures our site looks appealing and aligns with our brand, which I want to be strong and easily recognisable.

In the 'Blog' section, I made sure the latest post stands out, with older posts listed below. Readers can subscribe to our newsletter for updates on new blog posts.

I designed a special card layout for the 'Our Teams' page to display employee information. Each card includes a large picture at the top, a profile picture, a brief description, and a 'follow' button. I believe that adding a brief introduction to the employee description makes it more engaging for readers.

I applied the same card layout to the 'Careers' page to maintain a neat and organised appearance. This format also ensured that the page works well on various devices, including mobile phones, which is crucial as most people use their phones to read content these days.

## Technology
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) is the standard language for creating and structuring web content. It uses a system of tags to define and organise elements on a web page, such as text, images, links, and multimedia. HTML is essential for building the structure of web pages and is a fundamental building block for web development.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a web technology used to control the visual appearance and layout of web pages, enabling developers to design and format HTML elements to create attractive and responsive websites.
  
## Improvements
If I would have more time, I would like to add the following features to my application:
- Making the application more responsive to different sizes of device.
- Adding a dark mode/light mode option for users.
